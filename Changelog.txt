###### 23/03/2018 ######

-Inclusion of automatic extent restriction, 4 different ways:
	1-Buffer based on the maximum minimum distance among pair of points
	2-Buffer with radius delimited by the user (same for all species)
	3-Txt with buffer radius already specifies (one for each species)
	4-Ecorregions or any other maks
-New evaluation metrics:
	-Jaccard(ppab) -> Leroy et al 2018
	-OPR(ppab) -> Leroy et al 2018
	-Boyce -> Hirzel et al 2006; Cola et al 2016
	-F(cpb) -> Li & Guo 2013
-Future PCA corrections
-PCA now has as outputs a txt with the cummulative variance and another with the loadings
-Corrections on the validation output table

###### 03/04/2018 ######
-New option to manually insert test data (Tst argument; especially useful for invasion cenarios)
-Ensemble now created based on the partial models (Partial models TSS for the Sup options; makes it possible to compare the Ensemble with the algorithms)
-Removed the final model "evaluation", the only output is a table with the Thresholds used for the binary maps
-Adjustments in the location where the script checks for Presen-Future variables names consistency
-Changes in the choice of Threshold, onl one option is available now; options now based on the "dismo" package thresholds.

###### 23/04/2018 ######
-Changes in the uptput file N_Unique_OCC -> Unique occurrences for all species are saved inside the folder Result.
-Number of minor adjustments in the output files.
-Number of adjustments in interactions betwwen arguments
-Adjustment in interaction between checkerboard and MRst when sampling background points for Maxent
-Adjustments in all MSDM possibilities; MSDM can now be used with Geographical Partitions
-Removal of the possibility of using MSDM with future projections (were not to interact on the first place)

###### 23/04/2018 ######
**Release of the Beta Version in GitHub!

###### 04/05/2018 ######
-Fixed an issue that caused Maxent not to evaluate models in random partitions due to an inexistence of absence data in evaluation subset
-If the script finds all the necessary geographical masks it will use them instead of re-creating the masks
-If NMin<Number of Predictors the user will receive a warning that this may cause issues with some algorithms
-The way that Pseudo-Absences with environmental constrains were created was changed from an apply to a loop, as the former caused
 the program to experience lack of memory issues when dealing with a large number of species in a wide area
-If the script finds all the necessary environmental constrains masks it will use them instead of re-creating the masks
