-Inclusion of automatic extent restriction, 4 different ways:
	1-Buffer based on the maximum minimum distance among pair of points
	2-Buffer with radius delimited by the user (same for all species)
	3-Txt with buffer radius already specifies (one for each species)
	4-Ecorregions or any other maks
-New evaluation metrics:
	-Jaccard(ppab) -> Leroy et al 2018
	-OPR(ppab) -> Leroy et al 2018
	-Boyce -> Hirzel et al 2006; Cola et al 2016
	-F(cpb) -> Li & Guo 2013
-Future PCA corrections
-PCA now has as outputs a txt with the cummulative variance and another with the loadings
-Corrections on the validation output table

###### 03/04/2018 ######
-New option to manually insert test data (Tst argument; especially useful for invasion cenarios)
-Ensemble now created based on the partial models (Partial models TSS for the Sup options; makes it possible to compare the Ensemble with the algorithms)
-Removed the final model "evaluation", the only output is a table with the Thresholds used for the binary maps
-Adjustments in the location where the script checks for Presen-Future variables names consistency
-Changes in the choice of Threshold, only one option is available now; options now based on the "dismo" package thresholds.

###### 23/04/2018 ######
-Changes in the uptput file N_Unique_OCC -> Unique occurrences for all species are saved inside the folder Result.
-Number of minor adjustments in the output files.
-Number of adjustments in interactions betwwen arguments
-Adjustment in interaction between checkerboard and MRst when sampling background points for Maxent
-Adjustments in all MSDM possibilities; MSDM can now be used with Geographical Partitions
-Removal of the possibility of using MSDM with future projections (were not to interact on the first place)

###### 23/04/2018 ######
**Release of the Beta Version in GitHub!

###### 04/05/2018 ######
-Fixed an issue that caused Maxent not to evaluate models in random partitions due to an inexistence of absence data in evaluation subset
-If the script finds all the necessary geographical masks it will use them instead of re-creating the masks
-If NMin<Number of Predictors the user will receive a warning that this may cause issues with some algorithms
-The way that Pseudo-Absences with environmental constrains were created was changed from an apply to a loop, as the former caused
 the program to experience lack of memory issues when dealing with a large number of species in a wide area
-If the script finds all the necessary environmental constrains masks it will use them instead of re-creating the masks

###### 23/05/2018 ######
-Fit_ENM>Changes in how the model is projected for evaluation; HUGE decrease in the time taken during the modelling process (especially when dealing with a lot of cells)
-ENM_TheMetaLand>Addition of the argument SaveFinal, which gives the user the option to NOT create the final maps. (Also decreases the total time)
-Fit_ENM>Alterations in the MaxLike fitting, now instead of using the whole accessible area, model is fit using the same background as MaxEnt.
-Slight alterations in Fit_ENM to make the code clearer.
-Fit_ENM>Changes to SVM fitting! Now the algorithm fitted is the "C-svc"(Original classification SVM) with probabilities! Prediction is the probability that a cell is 0/1.
-Fit_ENM>SVM prediction is now made using the kernlab::predict, type="probabilities". Using the column that indicates the probability that a given data is a presence.
-Fit_ENM>GLM & GAM also had changes in the prediciton method. Now the prediction is of the type="response". Which gives predictions between 0-1.
-Fit_ENM>Ensemble evaluation now is conducted using the suitability in the "Test" subset of the several algorithms, instead of the whole area.
-Fit_ENM>PCA_Ensemble is also "evaluated" using only the test subset; (Standardized inside the subset!!)
-Fit_ENM>For PCA_Thr, occurrences in the test subset that are below the Threshold are transformed to 0! Previously, this analysis was made on all the cells of the Suitability rasters.
-ENM_TheMetaLand>Due to being removed from CRAN and DLLs issues, package "ecospat" is no longer loaded; instead, we implemented a supplementary "ecospat_boyce_TMLA" function that is loaded as an auxiliary function
-ENM_TheMetaLand>No longer need modifications to R.environ (N_MAX_DLLS), as package "ecospat" is no longer loaded

###### 06/11/2018 ######
-BlockPartition>Parallel Processing (~50% gain)
-BandsPartition>Parallel Processing (~50% gain)
-FitENM>Parallel Processing (>60% gain)
