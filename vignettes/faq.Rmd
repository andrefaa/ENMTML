We present here the anwser to some questions that are more common to arise while running `ENMTML`. If you couldn't find your issue among those questions, please [report](https://github.com/andrefaa/ENMTML/issues) it and we will make our best to help you run the package smoothly.  
At first the number fo arguments and the folder's structure may seem a little scary, but with little time you will get the hang of it and will start running ENM models!

<a name="Project Folder"> </a>

## <i class="fas fa-folder-open"></i> Project Folder


We **highly** recommend you to create a folder for your project!  
A general overview of the Project Folder and its containing sub-folders will look similar to this:  

Yellow are the *Mandatory Folders*, you **need** them to run the package.  
Green are the *Optional Folders*, only required according to your project design.  
Blue are *Output Folders*, those will be created during the modeling routine.

<a name="Function Arguments"> </a>

## <i class="fas fa-puzzle-piece"></i></i> Function Arguments

`ENMTML` consists of several arguments, which will be checked at the start of the modeling routine.

Take your time to check any *Error* returned during this argument check and use the `help` to correctly fill the arguments.


<a name="Occurrence Data"> </a>

## <i class="fas fa-table"></i></i> Occurrence Data

* [Occurrence File Type](#OccFileType)  
* [Data Format](#DataFormat) 

<a name="OccFileType"></a> 

### Occurrence File Type

`ENMTML` imports occurrence data from a **TXT** file with tabulation as separator **(tab-separated)**

<a name="DataFormat"></a> 

### Data Format

The **TXT** can have several columns, but three columns are mandatory:

* Species name  
* Longitude  
* Latitude  

They can be named to your preference as those will be inputted in the arguments *sp*, *x*, *y* of the `ENMTML` function.

Here's an example of an occurrence table for four sample species. 
```{r echo=F}
load("C:/Users/decoa/OneDrive/Trabajos/22 - ENM_Package/ENMTML/Data/occ.RData")
knitr::kable(occ[c(1:3,43:45,90:92,127:129),],row.names=F)
```


<a name="Predictors"> </a>

## <i class="fas fa-database"></i></i> Predictors 

* [Predictor File Type](#EnvFileType)  
* [Folder Arrangement](#FolderArrangement) 
* [Projections](#Projections) 

<a name="EnvFileType"></a> 

### Predictor File Type

`ENMTML` accepts predictors from several formats: **TIF**, **BIL**, **ASC** and **TXT(tab-separated)**

<a name="FolderArrangement"></a> 

### Folder Arrangement

Predictors must be within a **single folder**, which will be informed through the `pred_dir` argument.

<a name="Projections"></a> 

### Projections

Projections are indicated using the `proj_dir` argument.  
As it is common to usually make projections to multiple climate scenarios or extents, the arrangement of *Projection* folders consists in a major folder with different sub-folders (one for each climatic scenario or extent).  
**It is essential that the name of the variables in those folder match the names of variables within the `pred_dir` folder!**

<a name="Results"> </a>

## <i class="fas fa-clipboard-list"></i> Results

Results will be in a folder specified in the `result_dir` argument, or if you chose not to supply any folder `ENMTML` will create a folder named *Results* at the same level of your `pred_dir` folder (see this at the figure at the [Project Folder](#Project Folder) section.

Model Evaluation and information about the modelling routine can be found in several *txt* files within the Results folder.  
Important sub-folders with result maps are:  
- **Algorithm**: with *tif* present projections for the selected algorithms and the binary folders for the selected thresholds  
- **Ensemble**: with *tif* projections for the selected ensembles.  
- **Projection**: with *tif* projections for the different climatic scenarios/extents

Other sub-folders will be created according to the modeling routine and contain masks related to pseudo-absence allocation and geographical partition of datasets.
